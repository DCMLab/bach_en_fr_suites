DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 53, '1/4', 'III') ms3.Parse.bach_en_fr_suites.BWV813_06_Gigue
	The label 'III' in m. 51, onset 1/4 (MC 53, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of c.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('3', '5', '7') [('Eb', 'G', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 1 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.

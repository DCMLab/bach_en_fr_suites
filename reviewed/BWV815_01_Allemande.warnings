DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 20, '1/8', 'V(2)/ii') ms3.Parse.bach_en_fr_suites.BWV815_01_Allemande
	The label 'V(2)/ii' in m. 18, onset 1/8 (MC 20, onset 1/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Eb.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('b2', '3', '5') [('Fb', 'G', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.

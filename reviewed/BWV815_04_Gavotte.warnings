DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 14, '1/2', 'iv64(#7)') ms3.Parse.bach_en_fr_suites.BWV815_04_Gavotte
	The label 'iv64(#7)' in m. 11, onset 1/2 (MC 14, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Eb.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('b3', '#5', 'b1') [('Gb', 'B', 'Ebb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.

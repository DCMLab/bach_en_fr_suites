DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 15, '1/8', 'IVM7/IV') ms3.Parse.bach_en_fr_suites.BWV816_03_Sarabande
	The label 'IVM7/IV' in m. 15, onset 1/8 (MC 15, onset 1/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of G.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('4', '6', '1', '3') [('C', 'E', 'G', 'B')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.

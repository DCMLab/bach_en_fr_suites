DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 22, '3/8', 'V/V') ms3.Parse.bach_en_fr_suites.BWV817_01_Allemande
	The label 'V/V' in m. 20, onset 3/8 (MC 22, onset 3/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of E.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('#4', '#6', '#1') [('A#', 'C##', 'E#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
